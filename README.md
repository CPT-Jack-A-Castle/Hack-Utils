## Description
This tool was thought to allow us to manage several programs or third party tools from the same interface in a fast and intuitive way.

To install the script:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/davidahid/Hack-Utils
cd Hack-Utils/scripts/
bash installer.sh
```

To use netutils you must run it as root.
```
sudo hackutils
```
